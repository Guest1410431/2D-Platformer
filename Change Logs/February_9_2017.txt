Figured out how to implement the player and bike 
color customization. A decent amount of work and 
added 16 more colors than I anticipated. Since I 
am close to finishing the menus, I am strongly 
considering trashing all my work on the player 
class in order to start from the beginning on 
it...Only time will tell...
