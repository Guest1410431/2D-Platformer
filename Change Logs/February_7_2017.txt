Converted SpriteSheetManip.java into the Assets.java 
of the main project. Now able to easily change the 
text color gradients on the start of the project 
instead of having to change a file elsewhere and 
have to manually move it. Began working on the 
customization menu with a popup system for choosing 
player colors.
