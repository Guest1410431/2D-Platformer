# 2D-Platformer
I began this project when I was first learning Java. I soon became confused and overwhelmed and at a loss for online tutorials to help me. About a year later, I have restarted it, keeping only the sprites I made for the project. I have challenged myself to work on this for 30 minutes a day until I "finish" it. This is the only medium I plan on distributing it, as it is a project mainly for me to push myself and practice more and more every day.

## Plans
 1. A fully operational 2-D platformer with a developed story.
 2. 10 open world levels (similar to those of Mandagon, a game by Blind Sky Studios. 
 3. Leveling and skill point system.
 4. Enemy AI, friendly NPCs in specific towns, Shop/Vendor system.
